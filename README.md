# üí´ About Me:
I have a strong familiarity with SQL databases and am skilled in writing complex and optimized queries. In addition, I have experience working with non-relational databases such as MongoDB, CouchDB, and Redis.

My proficiency in PHP spans versions 5.3 to 8.2, and I am well-versed in the Laravel framework. I also possess frontend development skills, with a solid command of JavaScript and responsive web design. I'm familiar with frontend frameworks like Vue and React, as well as the jQuery library.

With practical experience in commercial development, I am adept at working in Linux environments and have the ability to administer web servers like Apache and Nginx. Additionally, I have basic knowledge of languages such as Go, Python, and C++.

I am well-versed in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and adhere to important principles such as KISS, DRY, YAGNI, and SOLID. My passion lies in continuous learning and improving my skills to tackle the ever-evolving challenges in technology.
